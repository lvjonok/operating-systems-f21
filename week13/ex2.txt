Recovery:
Do not care about deadlocks at the moment of execution. Start to think 
only when it occured, so do not waste time during processes runtime.
Prevention:
We have to ensure that at least one of deadlock conditions is blocked.
This algorithm might be simplier(faster) than avoidance.
Avoidance:
We surely know that the next decision will not lead to the deadlock 
(if some information is known in advance, decide if granting the resource is safe)
