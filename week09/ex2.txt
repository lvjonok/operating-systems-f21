1) We want to decrease the hit/miss ratio

Thus, we want to have more misses. It will happen, if we will have the `distance`(time) between two references to the same page more than the number of pages we have. That would mean, that we would anyway have time to refresh our need in page in R-bits.

Example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ... n
